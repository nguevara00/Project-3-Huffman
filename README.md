# Project 3: Huffman Encoding (Part 3 - Huffman Tree)

## Student Information
**Name:** Nicholas Guevara  
**Student ID:** 002-85-1971
**Repository:** https://github.com/nguevara00/Project-3-Huffman/

## Collaboration & Sources

This project is my own work and I wrote the code myself, with the following collaboration:

I asked for conceptual assistance from ChatGPT for:


- Explaining return errors involving creating copies 

- Identifying redundant file validation statements

## Implementation Details

- **Design** 
    -  Part 2 focuses on tokenizing input text, building a BST to count word frequences, constructing a priority queue using a vector, and generating the .tokens and .freq output files. The program also prints five required BST statistics to standard output.

- **Data Structures**
    - **`HuffmanTree`** â€“ Custom Huffman Tree implementation

## Testing & Status

- **Status** Program successfully compiles, runs, and produces expected outputs.
- **Testing** awaiting scripts
- **Known Issues** None.
